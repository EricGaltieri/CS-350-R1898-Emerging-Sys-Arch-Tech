# CS-350-R1898-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The problem set was to use the CS3220 board to read, interpret and display the ambient temperature of a room then based on this information and the user settings either turn on or off the heat to the room to match the desired temperature. 

    
    What did you do particularly well?
I was able to read and output the desired temperature with only a few data sets and was able to work through issue that arose during the creation of the app to successfully complete the task.

    Where could you improve?
The amount of time it took to find how to modify the program from UART to UART2 took a considerable amount of time and could have cause the task to go overtime. 

    What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I was working separate from the network and from any other tooling to develop this as a standalone project 

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Reference and question look up, as in I was able to find the root cause and find the corresponding information on how to move past issues thorough resources and manuals presented to me/

    How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project should not need maintenance as it only displays information and this can be parsed and added to to accomplish additional tasks such as cooling and monitoring over time.
